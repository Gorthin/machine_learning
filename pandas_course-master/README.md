What is the Pandas library?
Pandas is an open source library, which means it's completely free to use! What's more, we can even look into the source code and improve the solutions used! It provides powerful and easy-to-use data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

Growth in popularity of Python
Python is great for processing, preparing, analyzing, and modeling data. It is easy to learn and should not cause problems for a person who is just starting to learn programming. Over the past years and the growing popularity of artificial intelligence, Python has become a star in this sector. A lot of powerful libraries for machine learning or deep learning have been created. An example is the Tensorflow library created by Google.

Versatility of Applications
We can use Python on many levels. Whether at home, in the office or by running scripts in the cloud. Combined with a multitude of applications and a great set of tools such as Spyder, Jupyter Notebook, Zeppelin, IPython and other libraries, the Python data analysis environment stands out for its efficiency, productivity and great flexibility.

What, among other things, Pandas contains:
* a fast and efficient DataFrame object, which is analogous to a spreadsheet
tools for reading and writing data between different formats: CSV, TXT, XLSX, SQL databases, HDF5, JSON, HTML
* data aggregation tool and pivot tables
* efficient data linking
* hierarchical indexing
* time series
